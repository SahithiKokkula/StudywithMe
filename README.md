## 🎁 **Core Features**

### **Autonomous Agent System**
- 🧠 **Agent Brain**: Central intelligence that thinks, plans, and executes
- 🛠️ **Tool Registry**: 6 specialized tools working together
- 📊 **Session Memory**: Tracks your progress and patterns
- 🔍 **Smart Planning**: Breaks down complex requests automatically

### **Learning Tools**

| Tool | What It Does | Example Use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| 🧠 **Concept Explainer** | Simplifies complex topics | "Explain binary search trees" |
| 📄 **Content Summarizer** | Condenses long documents | "Summarize Chapter 5" |
| ❓ **Quiz Generator** | Creates practice tests | "Quiz me on algorithms" |
| 📖 **Question Solver** | Solves exam questions | "Solve: What is polymorphism?" |
| ✅ **Answer Evaluator** | Grades and provides feedback | "Check my answer on inheritance" |
| 🔍 **PDF Retriever** | Searches through documents | Automatic with PDF upload |

### **Smart Document Processing (RAG System)**

**RAG = Retrieval-Augmented Generation**

Instead of sending entire PDFs to the AI (which is slow and inefficient), Study Buddy uses RAG:

**How it works:**
1. 📄 **Upload PDF** → Text extracted
2. ✂️ **Chunking** → Splits into manageable pieces (1500 chars each)
3. 🧠 **Embedding** → Converts chunks to numerical vectors
4. 💾 **Storage** → Saves in ChromaDB vector database
5. 🔍 **Query** → Your question converted to vector
6. 🎯 **Search** → Finds most relevant chunks (semantic similarity)
7. 💬 **Generation** → AI uses only relevant chunks for answer

**Benefits:**
- ⚡ **Faster**: Only processes relevant content
- 🎯 **Accurate**: Focuses on specific information
- 📚 **Scalable**: Works with large documents (100+ pages)
- 💾 **Efficient**: No token limits or memory issues

**Features:**
- 📂 PDF upload and text extraction
- 🔍 Semantic search (understands meaning, not just keywords)
- 📚 Chapter-specific content retrieval
- 🧩 Context-aware responses from your documents

### **User Experience**
- 💬 Clean, intuitive chat interface
- 🎨 Dark theme for comfortable studying
- 📊 Real-time session statistics
- 🔄 Easy chat reset and session management
- 🧩 Optional thinking process visualization

### **RAG Pipeline in Study Buddy**

```
📄 PDF Document
    ↓
[Text Extraction] → PyPDF2 extracts all text
    ↓
[Chunking] → Split into 1500-char pieces with 150-char overlap
    ↓
[Embedding] → all-MiniLM-L6-v2 converts text to vectors
    ↓
[Vector Store] → ChromaDB stores embeddings
    ↓
[User Query] → "Explain recursion from Chapter 3"
    ↓
[Query Embedding] → Convert question to vector
    ↓
[Similarity Search] → Find top 3-5 most similar chunks
    ↓
[Context Retrieval] → Pull relevant text chunks
    ↓
[Prompt Engineering] → Combine query + retrieved context
    ↓
[AI Generation] → Groq LLaMA 3.3 70B generates answer using context
    ↓
[Response] → Accurate answer based on YOUR document
```

### **Technical Implementation**

**Embedding Model:**
- Model: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (Sentence Transformers)
- Dimensions: 384-dimensional vectors
- Size: ~80MB
- Speed: ~1000 sentences/second on CPU

**Vector Database:**
- Database: ChromaDB (open-source)
- Storage: Local disk (no cloud)
- Search: Cosine similarity
- Retrieval: Top-K nearest neighbors

**Chunking Strategy:**
- Chunk size: 1500 characters
- Overlap: 150 characters (10%)
- Splitter: RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
- Preserves: Sentence boundaries

**Retrieval Parameters:**
- Default K: 3 chunks for normal queries
- Max K: 5 chunks for complex questions
- Similarity threshold: Automatic (top K)
- Context window: ~4500 characters total

### **RAG in Action**

**Example 1: Simple Query**
```
User: "What is binary search?"
→ RAG finds chunks mentioning "binary search"
→ Retrieves definition, example, complexity
→ AI explains using your PDF's specific content
```

**Example 2: Chapter-Specific**
```
User: "Quiz me on Chapter 5"
→ RAG identifies chunks from Chapter 5
→ Retrieves key concepts from that chapter
→ AI generates questions based on chapter content
```

**Example 3: Complex Topic**
```
User: "Compare merge sort and quick sort"
→ RAG finds chunks about both algorithms
→ Retrieves complexity, use cases, pseudocode
→ AI provides side-by-side comparison from PDF
```

### **Advantages of Local RAG**

✅ **Privacy**: Documents never leave your computer  
✅ **Cost**: Zero API costs  
✅ **Speed**: No network latency  
✅ **Offline**: Works without internet  
✅ **Control**: Full control over chunking and retrieval  
✅ **Scalability**: Handle large documents easily
